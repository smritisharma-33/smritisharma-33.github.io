        <p>
          I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering Management with a focus on Big Data Infrastructure, Enterprise Database Management, Data Visualization, and Predictive Modeling at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My academic journey and hands-on experience have provided me with a strong foundation in data analytics, cloud computing, and decision-making for complex projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Data Science Infrastructure Intern at the <a class="text-link" href="http://dsrs.illinois.edu">Data Science Research Services</a>, I implemented cloud-based MLOps models, automating the deployment of Linux virtual machines to handle 1TB of data daily. This enhanced research capabilities and increased data processing speed by 50%, ensuring efficient handling of large-scale data for stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at <a class="text-link" href="https://www.worldchicago.org/">World Chicago</a>, I spearheaded the enhancement of their Salesforce SaaS platform, leveraging Salesforce Flow and Process Builder to automate processes. This initiative led to a 30% improvement in system efficiency and a 20% reduction in manual data entry. I also worked on redeveloping their official site and bolstering cybersecurity measures, ensuring a secure and streamlined user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <a class="text-link" href="https://www.capgemini.com/">Capgemini</a>, I led the AWS to Azure migration, improving scalability and security while reducing costs by 15%. I also developed and managed Azure Kubernetes Services and integrated CI/CD pipelines, enhancing platform responsiveness and user interaction by 20%.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am proficient in Python, Java, and React, with expertise in cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. My technical skills include working with Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, and automation tools like Zabbix, which I utilized in a project that improved VM uptime by 90% through an automated restart feature for Azure Spot VMs.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for data-driven decision-making and cloud solutions continues to drive me to explore new technologies and methodologies. I actively contribute to open-source projects and am eager to expand my impact within the tech community.
